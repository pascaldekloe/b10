## Decimal Numbers For The Rust Programming Language

The API provides intuitive and reliable operations at maximum performance. Both
parse and format options strictly preserve the numeric values during conversion.
Aritmetic operations are lossless by design. Numeric overflows are all included
in the result, and there is no rounding unless explictly mentioned otherwise.

 * Values in 64 bits instead of arbitrary-precision
 * Precissions/resolutions fixed with `const` generics
 * Maximised compile-time computation (with generics)
